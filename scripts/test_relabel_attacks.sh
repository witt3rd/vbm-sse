# Tier 1: the relabel-attack suite (scripts/relabel-attacks.sh) judges a gate change by mechanical checks, and it can FAIL. On this tree:
#  (1) every attack is REFUSED by the tree's own gates (PASS, exit 0), except the Lean ones (Tier 2 and the lander run those);
#  (2) SABOTAGE (the negative self-test): with the gate each attack relies on replaced by a stub that always succeeds, every attack PASSES the gates and the suite FAILS (exit 1, no REFUSED line);
#  (3) a gate that fails on the UNATTACKED tree is BROKEN, not "refused" (a control), an attack of the suite missing from the tree FAILS, and the lander must call the suite and the diff judge (--check-wired).
# Every attack runs in its own scratch clone, so the runs are independent: they run in parallel and the slowest sets the wall time.
