# Lint: no tooling runs a declared long runner (scripts/long-runners.txt) outside scripts/run-scoped.sh. An aborted whole-shim mutation run once left orphans
# (parent pid 1) for hours; every long runner is run under a transient scope with a bound (scripts/run-scoped.sh), reaped on exit.
# Two kinds of entry: `NAME` (callers must wrap) and `self NAME` (the runner's own file must carry the guard that re-execs it under the helper).
# A line RUNS a `NAME` runner when the name is at command position (line start, after ; & | ( $( -- python3 bash sh time); it is allowed when `run-scoped.sh` appears earlier on that line.
# Comments and mentions inside strings are not runs. --selftest (Tier 1 runs it): a direct call, a mise/python3/bash-prefixed call and a pipeline call each FAIL; a scoped call passes;
# a `self` runner without the guard FAILS and one with it passes.
# LIMIT (stated, accepted): this is a guard against accidents, not against a determined subject. Evasion by indirection (a variable holding the runner, a bash -c string, a renamed copy) is not detected.
