# Tier 1: the shared negative test of the ran-evidence class fix (docs/decisions/0002-ran-evidence.md). The defect: a negative self-test that passes when the thing under test never ran (a heavy-tool guard
# REFUSED `lake`; the zero-warning check saw a failure with no warning in it and called the gate clean). The class fix is that every gate and test prints `ran: NAME: N cases` (N > 0) and a refusal, skip
# or guard exit is a FAIL. Each shape is shown here to FAIL: a refused tool, a missing one, a timeout, a silent exit 0, a zero count, a SKIPPED line; and one clean case passes (the control of each).
