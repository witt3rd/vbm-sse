# The relabel-attack suite: a change to a GATE (its source, a list it reads, a baseline, tier1.sh, the lander) is judged by MECHANICAL checks, not by a human.
# The gate review (the G6 report) showed every gate can be satisfied by relabeling; each such demonstration is a small ATTACK (scripts/attacks/NN-name.sh) that the
# PROPOSED tree's gates must still REFUSE. The suite applies every attack, one at a time, in a scratch clone of the proposed tree and runs the proposed gates on it:
# an attack any gate lets through REFUSES THE CHANGE. Attacks are judged against the proposed tree itself as the new base (what could the NEXT change do?).
#   scripts/relabel-attacks.sh [--tree DIR] [--base REF] [--only ID] [--sabotage] [--no-lean]
#   scripts/relabel-attacks.sh --list | --check-wired [--tree DIR]
# --tree DIR (default .): the proposed tree (a git checkout; its HEAD plus any working-tree edits). --base REF (default origin/main): the merge-base of the change; only
#   used to check that no attack of THIS suite was dropped from the tree (the suite that judges a change is main's copy: the proposal cannot weaken its own judge).
# For each attack: a CONTROL (every gate command passes on the unattacked tree: else the gates are broken, and "refused" would be vacuous), then the attack is applied and
#   committed, then each gate command runs; the attack is REFUSED when one of them fails (and, when the attack names one, its output carries the expected words).
# --sabotage: the suite's own negative self-test: before each attack, every file the attack names in ATK_GATE_FILES is replaced by a stub that always succeeds ("a gate that
#   cannot fail"); the attack must then be NOT refused, i.e. the suite must FAIL. A suite that still passes with its gate broken is itself broken (scripts/test_relabel_attacks.sh).
# --no-lean: skip the attacks that need `lake` (ATK_LEAN=1): for the cheap Tier 1 self-test.   --list: the attack ids.   --check-wired: the lander's hooks call this suite and the diff judge.
# Exit: 0 PASS (every attack refused) | 1 FAIL (an attack passed the gates, a control failed, or an attack of the suite is missing from the tree) | 2 cannot decide.
# The LAST line is PASS/FAIL with the seconds it took. An attack file defines: ATK_DESC, ATK_GATES (commands, run in the scratch root with $ATK_BASE = the proposed commit),
# ATK_GATE_FILES, optionally ATK_LEAN=1 and ATK_EXPECT (a regex the refusal must print), and a function atk_apply (cwd = scratch root). scripts/attacks/lib.sh: helpers.
