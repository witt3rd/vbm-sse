/-! Ledger gate (adapted from the ledger gate of the project these gates were first built in): renders `docs/proof-ledger.md` from
`LeanSseProofs/Ledger.lean`, checks that every named theorem exists and is a theorem, and ratchets the counts against `scripts/ledger-baseline.txt`
(proved may only rise, open may only fall). `--write` updates the baseline. Exit 1 on regression.

"Proved" means proved about code the exports run. The gate walks the definitions the entry points (`scripts/closure-entries.txt`) reach, the same walk as
`scripts/ClosureGate.lean`, and classes every cited theorem by the `LeanSse` functions its statement mentions: yes (every one is reached), partly
(some), no (none: the statement is about a model the exports never run). A claim whose cited theorems are all `no` is shown as partial, not proved.
A definition the exports do not name but run through a refinement theorem (`scripts/ledger-bridges.txt`: `spec-def theorem reached-def`: the reference
recogniser and the fast parser) counts as reached; the theorem must exist and mention both names. With NO entry points (the skeleton) reach is not
applied: the column reads `-` and nothing is demoted; it applies from the first export on. Sorts (types, predicates) are ignored: only functions run. -/
