# quotes, nothing is ever expanded or executed while reading it, and an unknown key is an error (a typo must not silently turn a gate off).
# The values that name commands (LAND_GATES_CMD, LAND_TEST_CMD, ...) are run later, by the lander, with `bash -c` inside the scratch worktree.

# The keys and their defaults are the stable interface of this tool (README, "Configuration"): conf_defaults sets them, conf_parse reads a file.
