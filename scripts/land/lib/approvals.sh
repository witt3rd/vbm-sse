# Gate-edit approvals (docs/gate-edit-approvals.md). Sourced by bin/land-direct, never run.
#
# A removed or changed line in a gate-defining file is accepted ONLY on an exact diff-hash match against an approval already on the base branch.
# The approvals file (LAND_APPROVALS, default scripts/gate-edit-approvals.txt) holds one record per line:
#
#     FILE-SET | sha256 of the exact diff of that set | reason | YYYY-MM-DD
#
# FILE-SET is one plain path (a gate-edit approval, as always) or a CANONICAL set: plain paths sorted (C locale), unique, joined by commas, no spaces.
# PROTECTED SETS (LAND_PROTECTED_LIST, optional): a landing whose net diff touches ANY path of the repository's protected-paths list is refused unless an approval whose
# FILE-SET is exactly the touched paths and whose hash is the net diff over exactly those paths is on the base branch (ga_protected below); the same one-time rules apply.
#
# The hash is the sha256 of the CANONICAL DIFF of FILE: what `land-direct --print-gate-diff-hash FILE` prints (ga_canon below: fixed flags, no config, `index` lines dropped).
# The rules (each one has a negative self-test in tests/test_approvals.sh):
#   - approvals are read from the BASE branch, never from the change: a landing cannot approve itself;
#   - an approval lands ALONE: a commit that adds a record changes no other file, adds exactly ONE line and removes none, and so does the landing that holds it (the edit comes in a later landing);
#   - one-time: a landing whose diff of FILE hashes to a record on base must REMOVE that record in the same landing (the consumption); a record is never reusable;
#   - a record removed without being consumed is refused (flagged), unless it is stale (the window closed: tidying up) or withdrawn by an `Approval-Withdrawn: FILE <hash prefix>` trailer in a landing that changes nothing else (announced to the judge);
#   - stale (older than LAND_APPROVAL_DAYS) or future-dated records approve nothing; a malformed or self-referencing record added is refused.
# HONEST LIMIT: an agent with landing rights could write its own approval line. The control is that approvals are visible one-commit records the independent judge
# reads before the edit lands: the approval commit is announced to the judge BEFORE the edit commit, always.
