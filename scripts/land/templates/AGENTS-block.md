## Landing (direct to main, no PRs)
- Work in a worktree off a fresh origin/main. Diff ≤150 production lines, ≤45 min without a passing build; over either, stop and write a decomposition plan.
- Commit locally with Conventional Commits. Land only with `scripts/land-direct`; never push main yourself, never force-push it, never open a PR.
- New behaviour lands behind a flag that defaults OFF. Interface changes: add beside the old, migrate callers, delete at zero references.
- Everything runs before the push, once (Tier 1 on the rebased tree); nothing runs after it. If main is ever red, whoever sees it reverts the offending commit with `git revert` and lands the revert; the author fixes forward in a new worktree. A landing must not add a failure.
- `scripts/land/` and `scripts/land-direct` are a pinned copy of vbm-land: never edit them (`scripts/land/bin/land-check` fails the gate). Change the tool upstream, then `scripts/land/bin/land-update <tag>`.
- Decide anything reversible and log it. Escalate only money, data loss, secrets, publishing, or harm to a third party; say so in one line and stop.
