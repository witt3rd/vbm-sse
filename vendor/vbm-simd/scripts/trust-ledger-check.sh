# Tier 1: the trust ledger (docs/trust-ledger.md) names everything outside our direct control that vbm-simd executes or depends on. The REQUIRED set is derived from the tree, not from the
# ledger: every @[extern] symbol in the Lean sources, every C header under include/, the build pins, the pieces the Lean pin brings (compiler,
# runtime, bundled clang/ld.lld), and the tools the scripts call. A new boundary with no entry FAILS; an entry covering nothing required FAILS. The checker (scripts/trust_ledger.py)
# negative-self-tests itself on every run: remove any entry and it must fail. Prints `trust ledger: N entries ...`.
# Usage: scripts/trust-ledger-check.sh [ledger]
