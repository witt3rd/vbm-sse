/-! # `VbmSimd.Cursor`: walking the set bits of a mask array, in order, without materialising an index

A scanner turns a text into a mask array (one 64-bit word per 64 bytes, a set bit for each interesting position); its consumer wants the positions of the set bits, one at a time, in order. A cursor is a word index `w` and
`m`, the bits of word `w` not yet consumed: the next position is `64 * w + ctz m`, consuming it is `m &&& (m - 1)`, and when `m` is empty the cursor moves on to the next non-empty word. No allocation, no index array.
Carry `w` and `m` as two loop arguments (not as a pair that is returned from a non-inlined function) to keep them unboxed.
Proved against the list of set positions (`[VS-7]`, `VbmSimdProofs.Cursor`): the positions the cursor yields, in order, are exactly the set bits of the words. -/

/-! ## The next set bit at or after a position (stateless)

`cursorNext` walks forward and carries `(w, m)`. A consumer that does not want to carry a cursor (it knows a position `j` and asks "where is the next set bit?") calls `nextSet masks j`: one word, masked below `j`, and
`ctz`; the following words only if that one is empty. It returns `64 * wordCount masks` (the end) when there is none. Proved: `nextSet_spec` (`[VS-10]`). -/
